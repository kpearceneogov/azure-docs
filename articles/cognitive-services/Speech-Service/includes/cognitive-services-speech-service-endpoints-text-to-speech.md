### Custom neural voices

If you've created a custom neural voice font, use the endpoint that you've created. You can also use the endpoints listed below, replacing the `{deploymentId}` with the deployment ID for your neural voice model.

| Region | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Australia East | `https://australiaeast.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Brazil South | `https://brazilsouth.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Canada Central | `https://canadacentral.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Central US | `https://centralus.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| East Asia | `https://eastasia.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| East US | `https://eastus.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| East US 2 | `https://eastus2.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| France Central | `https://francecentral.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| India Central | `https://centralindia.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Japan East | `https://japaneast.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Japan West | `https://japanwest.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Korea Central | `https://koreacentral.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| North Central US | `https://northcentralus.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| North Europe | `https://northeurope.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| South Central US | `https://southcentralus.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| Southeast Asia | `https://southeastasia.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| UK South | `https://uksouth.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| West Europe | `https://westeurope.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| West Central US | `https://westcentralus.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| West US | `https://westus.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |
| West US 2 | `https://westus2.voice.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/v1?deploymentId={deploymentId}` |

> [!NOTE]
> The above regions are available for neural voice model hosting and real-time synthesis. Custom neural voice training is only available in the three regions: East US, Southeast Asia, and UK South. But users can easily copy a neural voice model from the three regions to other different regions listed above.

### Long audio API

The Long audio API is available in multiple regions with unique endpoints.

| Region | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Australia East | `https://australiaeast.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| East US | `https://eastus.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| India Central | `https://centralindia.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| South Central US | `https://southcentralus.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| Southeast Asia | `https://southeastasia.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| UK South | `https://uksouth.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
| West Europe | `https://westeurope.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com` |
